1. Males make up the biggest number of users. They also make up the majority of revenue for the game. 

2. Female players spend more per purchase than males. From this we can concluded that a loyal female customer is more valuable than a loyal male in terms of revenue generation. However there may not be enough volume of data to support this.  

3. If the game were to run ad campaigns the target demo should be males age 20-24.

4. The Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm is the most purchased item, and also brings in the most revenue for the game. I would conclude that this item brings the most value / entertainment value to the players, and the game should consider adding more variations of this item.
